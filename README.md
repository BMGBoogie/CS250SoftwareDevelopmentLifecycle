How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  The most beneficial way I have found to interpret user needs and wants and implement them into a script or development structure is by utilizing user stories. User stories helps eliminate the guess work in creation and can put different perspectives on features that may not come up in normal conversation. There are numerous ways a feature can be used, and if some of these processes are not acounted for, then the feature may not produce the desired outcome every time.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Utilizing the agile method helps alleviate burn out and spreads the workload of a project in a much more even way. Also, the short term achievements of each sprint's deliverables can help maintain motivation among the team. Gathering all of the comprehension of the ideal goal and building your backlog around that can help ensure clarity throughout the development and can help keep members on track.
  
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  I think that being a good team member isn't about knowing everything and overworking yourself, but being willing to learn and work cohesively. The agile method has definitely taught me a way of working in which each member functions like a cog in a machine. No one person is responsible for handling all of the tasks, but each person contributing in any way they can will help the team achieve each desired outcome.
